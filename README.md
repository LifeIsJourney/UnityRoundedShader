## See also
The below two sites appeared when I searched on google.

https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldfSDj

https://github.com/Nobinator/Unity-UI-Rounded-Corners


The first one is the Shadertoy which is very famous web site about shaders.

The second web site also gave me an idea to implement it.

I have read the shader codes which made by Nobinator, but I didn't understand full of it.

I was not cleared about fwidth() function in cg shader.

So, I have re-written the shader codes more understandable and added a circle shader.
